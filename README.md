As the System Administrator, Jane claimed the ticket and immediately escalated its priority to 'Emergency,' adjusting the SLA to Sev-A due to the critical nature of the issue.  After reviewing the details, she contacted the customer to share her initial diagnosis and informed them that a potential solution is in progress.
