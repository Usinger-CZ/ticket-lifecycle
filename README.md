A new ticket has been generated following a report from end user Karen Stafford regarding a business-critical outage. She provided a brief description of the issue but requires further investigation to determine the root cause and implement a resolution.

John from the Support Department has received the ticket and promptly assigned it to the appropriate team for further action. Additionally, he left an internal note recommending that the ticket's priority and SLA be escalated, given the potential impact on business operations.

<p>
As the System Administrator, I, Jane, claimed the ticket and immediately escalated its priority to "Emergency," adjusting the SLA to Severity-A (Sev-A) due to the critical nature of the issue. After reviewing the details, I reached out to the customer to communicate my initial diagnosis of the problem and informed them that I have a potential solution in progress.
